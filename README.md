# Hands-on-Machine-Learning-and-Neural-Network
## image-classification-CNN
Built CNN model with transfer learning to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat. Data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats)
## Reinforcement_Learning_Cost_Aware_AB_Testing
Implement cost-aware A/B Testing using multiple reinforcement learning techniques(greedy/near-greedy, gradient method) in order to understand the effectiveness of each treatment option without incurring too much costs. Problem statement, simulation setup, strategy implementation and results summary are included.
